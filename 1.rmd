## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
# Calculate total number of steps per day

```{r}

>*The values of these estimates differ from the estimates of the first part of the assignment. Actually they are higher and they are closer together. This result is to be expected as we imputed NAs with the values of the average activity pattern. As we can see from the first histogram NAs had the effect of a high frequency bin for zero total steps (denoting whole days with NAs). At the second histogram we can see that the bin for zero total steps has a lower frequency while the bin for 10000-11000 total steps has a higher frequency. The total number of steps of the average activity pattern are 10762 and days full with NAs now have this total number of steps. Thus, the imputation had the effect of diminishing some outliers (zero total steps resulting from NAs for whole days) and thus the mean is closer to the median.*

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
# load required library lubridate
require(lubridate)

# Create day number (1:7) from date
dayNum <- wday(dataimp$date)

# add column weekday as factor with two levels with labels weekend and weekday
dataimp$weekday <- factor((dayNum > 1 & dayNum < 7), levels=c(FALSE, TRUE), labels=c('weekend', 'weekday'))

# Average daily activity pattern for weekdays
mean_steps_per_interval_wdays <- dataimp[(dataimp$weekday == levels(dataimp$weekday)[2]),] %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarize(Weekdays = round(mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)))

# Average daily activity pattern for weekends
mean_steps_per_interval_weekends <- dataimp[(dataimp$weekday == levels(dataimp$weekday)[1]),] %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarize(Weekends = round(mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)))

# Add average daily activity pattern for weekends as a new column to weekdays
mean_steps_per_interval_wdays$Weekends <- mean_steps_per_interval_weekends$Weekends

# Load required libraries
require(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

# Reshape data for plotting
dd = melt(mean_steps_per_interval_wdays, id.vars = c("interval"))

# Create panel plot
g1 <- ggplot(data= dd) +
      geom_line(aes(x=interval, y=value, colour=variable)) +
      facet_wrap( ~ variable, nrow = 2, ncol = 1) + 
      labs(title = "Average daily activity pattern: Weekdays vs Weekends", 
           x = "Intervals", y = "Average steps per interval") 
# Show the plot
g1
```
 
>*We can see the differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends. On weekends there are less average steps during the morning (5:15-9:00) and the evening (18:20-19:35) than on weekdays. On weekends on the other hand there are more average steps during the day (10:00 - 20:30). This behavior is more apparent in the following plot:*

```{r}
g2 <- ggplot(data= dd) +
      geom_line(aes(x=interval, y=value, colour=variable)) +
      labs(title = "Average daily activity pattern: Weekdays vs Weekends", 
           x = "Intervals", y = "Average steps per interval") 
g2
```
